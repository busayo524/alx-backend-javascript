# 0x05. NodeJS Basics  

## 📖 Project Description  
This project dives into the foundational concepts of **Node.js**, including creating HTTP servers, working with modules, handling files, and structuring server-side code efficiently. It is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum.  

---

## ⚙️ Learning Objectives  
By the end of this project, you will be able to:  
- Understand how to run JavaScript code using Node.js.  
- Use Node.js modules and package management effectively.  
- Create HTTP servers with Node.js and Express.  
- Read and write files in Node.js.  
- Organize and structure server-side JavaScript code.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime  
- **Express.js** - Web framework  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **Git** - Version control  
- **ESLint** - Linter for code quality

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/busayo524/alx-backend_javascrript.git
   mkdir 0x05-nodejs-basics
   cd 0x05-nodejs-basics

    Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the application:

    node app.js

📄 Features

    HTTP Server: Responds to various endpoints with appropriate content.
    File Handling: Read and manipulate data from files.
    Routing: Organized routes for different application features.
    Middleware: Used for logging and request handling.

📋 Tasks Implemented
Example Task List:

    Basic HTTP Server
    Modularization: Use of external and core Node.js modules.
    File I/O: Reading and writing files asynchronously.
    Express Integration: Building RESTful APIs.
    Middleware: Creating custom middleware for logging.

🧪 Testing

To run tests:
npm test
Test cases are implemented using Jest or Mocha/Chai for unit testing.
